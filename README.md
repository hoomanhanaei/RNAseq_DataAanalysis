# RNA Sequencing Data Analysis: A 2025 Review and Updated Snakemake Pipeline

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use Snakemake pipeline, ensuring that it is ready to run "out-of-the-box" in 2025. The pipeline was developed by replicating the RNA-seq data analysis steps outlined in the original work by Clarissa M. Koch and colleagues, whose well-structured article inspired this effort. I aim to assess whether the methods, tools, and approaches described in their paper are still relevant and effective in 2025, while making the process more accessible to users.
