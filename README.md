## Introduction

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use Snakemake pipeline, ensuring that it is ready to run "out-of-the-box" in 2025. The pipeline was developed by replicating the RNA-seq data analysis steps outlined in the original work by Clarissa M. Koch and colleagues [^1], whose well-structured article inspired this effort. I aim to assess whether the methods, tools, and approaches described in their paper are still relevant and effective in 2025, while making the process more accessible to users.

## Objectives

- **Replicate the original analysis**: Recreate the RNA-seq data analysis pipeline outlined by Koch et al. and evaluate whether the tools and methods used in 2018 are still valid in 2025.
- **Compare with other publications**: In addition to replicating the original work, compare their methods and tools with those used in other recent publications.
- **Provide an updated Snakemake pipeline**: Develop a fully automated and easy-to-use Snakemake workflow to run the entire analysis from raw data to final results with minimal setup.
- **Ensure modern compatibility**: Ensure that the pipeline uses up-to-date tools and methods that are efficient and well-supported in 2025, replacing deprecated tools where necessary.
